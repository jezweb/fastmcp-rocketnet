# Rocket.net MCP Servers Implementation Scratchpad

## Project Overview
Creating a modular MCP server system for Rocket.net API integration using FastMCP framework.
Base Directory: `/home/jez/Documents/fastmcp-rocketnet`

## Architecture
- **Multi-server approach**: Each server handles specific API domains
- **Independent servers**: Each server is self-contained (no shared packages)
- **FastMCP Cloud ready**: Deployable to cloud.fastmcp.com
- **Single repository**: All servers in one repo for easier management
- **Flexible authentication**: Credentials via env vars OR tool parameters

## Servers Implemented

### ~~1. rocketnet-shared~~ (Removed - Not Compatible with FastMCP Cloud)
- Each server now has embedded auth.py and utils.py
- No shared packages allowed for FastMCP Cloud deployment

### 2. rocketnet-sites (Core Site Management) ✅
- [x] List sites
- [x] Get site details
- [x] Create/Update/Delete sites
- [x] Site status monitoring
- [x] Site cloning
- [x] Location management
- [x] Plan management
- [x] Dashboard resources

### 3. rocketnet-domains (Domain Management) ✅
- [x] Domain CRUD operations
- [x] Main domain management
- [x] SSL certificate management
- [x] Edge/CDN settings per domain

### 4. rocketnet-backups (Backup & Recovery) ✅
- [x] Create backups
- [x] List/Restore backups
- [x] Download backups
- [x] Backup scheduling
- [x] Test restoration

### 5. rocketnet-performance (CDN & Performance) ✅
- [x] Cache purging (files and full)
- [x] CDN request reports
- [x] Bandwidth monitoring
- [x] Visitor analytics
- [x] Cache performance metrics

### 6. rocketnet-wordpress (WordPress Management) ✅
- [x] Plugin management (install, update, activate, delete)
- [x] Theme management
- [x] WordPress status monitoring
- [x] WP-CLI command execution
- [x] SSO login URL generation

### 7. rocketnet-analytics (Reporting & Analytics) ✅
- [x] Access logs analysis
- [x] WAF security events
- [x] Request volume by source
- [x] Site health reports
- [x] Account-wide visitor overview

### 8. rocketnet-billing (Billing & Account) ✅
- [x] Invoice management
- [x] Payment methods
- [x] Account usage monitoring
- [x] User administration
- [x] Product catalog

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Foundation ✅
1. ✅ Create project structure
2. ✅ Create scratchpad
3. ✅ Initialize Git repository
4. ✅ ~~Create rocketnet-shared package~~ (Removed - incompatible with FastMCP Cloud)
5. ✅ Implement authentication (embedded in each server)

### Phase 2: Core Servers ✅
1. ✅ rocketnet-sites server
2. ✅ rocketnet-domains server
3. ✅ rocketnet-backups server
4. ✅ rocketnet-performance server

### Phase 3: Advanced Servers ✅
1. ✅ rocketnet-wordpress server
2. ✅ rocketnet-analytics server
3. ✅ rocketnet-billing server

### Phase 4: Deployment ✅
1. ✅ Create comprehensive documentation
2. ✅ Set up GitHub repository (https://github.com/jezweb/fastmcp-rocketnet)
3. ✅ Configure for FastMCP Cloud (each server independent)
4. ✅ Create example configurations

## Git Commits Log
- Initial commit: Project structure and README
- Add rocketnet-shared package (later removed)
- Add rocketnet-sites server
- Add rocketnet-backups server
- Make servers independent (remove shared package)
- Add rocketnet-domains and rocketnet-performance servers
- Add rocketnet-wordpress, rocketnet-analytics, and rocketnet-billing servers
- Complete 7-server suite implementation

## Notes & Decisions
- Using modular structure similar to SimPro/Phorest implementations
- Each server can be deployed independently to FastMCP Cloud
- **IMPORTANT**: No shared packages - each server is self-contained
- Flexible authentication: credentials can be in env vars OR passed per tool call
- Environment variables: ROCKETNET_EMAIL/ROCKETNET_USERNAME and ROCKETNET_PASSWORD
- All servers follow FastMCP v2 patterns with proper typing and documentation
- Auth generates fresh JWT token for each request (no caching for security)

## API Endpoints Mapping

### Authentication
- POST `/authentication/login` → Handled by shared package

### Sites
- GET/POST/PUT/DELETE `/sites` → rocketnet-sites server

### Domains
- Domain management endpoints → rocketnet-domains server

### WordPress
- Plugin/Theme endpoints → rocketnet-wordpress server

### Backups
- Backup endpoints → rocketnet-backups server

### Analytics
- Reporting endpoints → rocketnet-analytics server

### Billing
- Invoice/Payment endpoints → rocketnet-billing server

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each tool
- Integration tests with mock API
- End-to-end testing with test account
- Validation against actual API responses

## Deployment Configuration
- FastMCP Cloud compatible
- Environment variables in .env.example
- Each server has its own requirements.txt
- Shared package installed as dependency

## Current Status: COMPLETED ✅
Last Updated: 2025-01-17

## Summary
