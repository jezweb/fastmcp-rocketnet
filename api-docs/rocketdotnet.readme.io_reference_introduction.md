Rocket.net offer a series of RESTful APIs that are incredibly simple to work with to manage every aspect of your Rocket.net account.

We currently generate authentication tokens based off your email address and password used to login at [https://control.rocket.net.](https://control.rocket.net./) Once you have a valid token it can be sent to our API to complete your requests.

Please note that this is a JSON API and that when sending JSON to our API you will need to specify the content type with the header `Content-type: application/json`. We recommend setting `Accept: application/json` but it is not required like `Content-type` is.
